## How to use

Run `npm i` to install and then `npm run start`. You'll have to provide a Personal Access Token from your account, the id of the target space, and the number of the max simultaneous operations. The default for the max simultaneous operations is 20 but you can increase it slightly to make the process faster if your computer and connection can handle it or you can decrease it if you want to use less bandwidth and memory.
